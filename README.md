# boardgame-playsession-randomizer
A web script (php) which takes a pool of games as input (retained) and chooses a variable number of random options to choose from in a survey. Chosen items have a lower chance to be in the next survey.

The script is not yet fully finished, so you may encounter some "not yet implemented" errors for some features.

##### Installation
It's simple as "copy all files provided" to your web server and open index.php in your web browser.
No database needed.

##### Update
Delete all files except those in your /data folder (and the config.json if you'd like to retain your given password). Then copy the new files over.
